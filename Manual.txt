1) first you should choose one of the 6 scheduling algorithms by clicking one of the buttons
2) according to the algorithm chosen a window is displayed requiring processes info
3) Enter the processes info one by one, after each process press add and when you are finished click done
-note that only numbers (no string) is allowed as input, also an empty string is not allowed 
- the entered processes are now shown in the table
4) The Gantt chart window now has your processes schedule and the average waiting time is calculated in the MainFrame
5) If one or more of the processes you're entering have a floating point value click yes to "floating value?" before entering the processes info(after or before choosing the scheduling algorithm)
 note that this will consider all of the next processes you enter as floating even if you choose another algorithm and start re entering processes.
-If you wish to undo it at anytime press "no" button
-Don't use this property if non of the processes info (arrival time/burst time) is floating
-pressing no before entering process values with no floating point is important if you have previously chosen yes. 
6) if you would like to choose another algorithm to simulate you can by pressing the button with the algorithms name
7) repeat the steps as before 
8) to end the app just close any of the windows.

-note that: if the average waiting time is not fully visibly maximizing the windows size to the right will help
also same with the numbers in the Gantt chart
- the program supports all schedulers 
- RR doesnt support idle times
